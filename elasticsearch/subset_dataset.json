The Aragon project is open source and led by the Aragon Foundation. It also includes a token, ANT, that grants voting rights to make decisions about the direction of future development. Eventually, Aragon hopes to be a fully decentralized autonomous organization and dApp that’s a neutral jurisdiction for anyone to create an organization on the blockchain. \n\nIn the early days of development, the project is relying on the nonprofit Aragon Foundation to provide direction and support as the project gets off the ground. The idea, however, is to eventually dissolve, scale back, or change the nature of the Foundation as community support grows. In the future, Aragon will be entirely decentralized and community led. Holders of the ANT token will have voting rights on all issues concerning Aragon. Aragon is an open source, non-profit project. It has many contributors. It also doesn’t technically have a CEO or CTO. Instead, it has a project lead. But don’t get it twisted, the lead is essentially the CEO. uis Cuende is leading the project. In 2011, he received a “Best Underage European Programmer” award, and he’s a recipient of Forbes’ 30 under 30 recognition. He’s a young guy, but with leadership and technical chops. He has advised the Vice President of the European Commission and is an MIT Innovators Under 35 awardee. He has founded several startups and created the first Linux distribution with face login.\n\nAragon offers several core features. It has a module for identity management and closely related modules for ownership and access control. Other modules include shareholder voting, fundraising through token generation, HR onboarding and payroll, and accounts payable/receivable. Taken together, the core functionality of Aragon covers the critical aspects of accounting, governance, and identity that make modern companies work. As you can see, these modules make up most of the administrative functions that a modern company or organization requires. It’s important to emphasize that these modules can individually be turned on and off, providing instant customization for the company’s needs. In addition, all of the code behind Aragon is open source. A company’s development team could edit them as needed to fulfill the company’s requirements. \n\nThe modular design of Aragon doesn’t stop with the core modules that come standard. Just as companies can edit existing modules, they’re free to develop completely new models as well. They can also develop atop the data and structures of existing models for extended functionality. The modular nature of Aragon, combined with its open source ethos, means we could see a whole ecosystem of free to use modules that extend capacity for organizations on Aragon. Aragon explicitly has the goal of creating a digital jurisdiction. Just like countries have jurisdiction over their citizens when it comes to courts of law, Aragon wants to create the first digital court of law. This court wouldn’t operate based on country boundaries. Instead, it would help enforce digital contracts between organizations on the Aragon platform.\n\nThe ANT token is the native token of Aragon and plays a critical role in the governance model and incentive structure of the platform. It represents the wealth of the decentralized economy and was initially sold during Aragon’s highly successful ICO in May 2017 that raised $24 million. Subsequently, the ANT token has come to represent a powerful share of the governance on the platform. ANT holders can vote on proposals, participate in arbitration and the decentralized court system, and help contribute to the non-profit Aragon Foundation or to research and development through the Aragon Nest program.","homepage_link":["https://aragon.org/","https://aragon.one/"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xa117000000f279d81a1d3cc75430faa017fa5a2e","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xa117000000f279d81a1d3cc75430faa017fa5a2e"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/aragonproject","github":"['https://github.com/aragon/aragon-core']","image_url":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/681/large/JelZ58cv_400x400.png?1601449653","all_time_high(usd)":"14.64","all_time_high_date":"2021-04-06T09:35:37.795Z","market_cap":"169207378.0","current_price":"4.42","price_change_percentage_1y":32.90001,"price_change_percentage_30d":1.92255,"price_change_percentage_7d":-8.82858,"news":[{"title":"Alibaba, Tencent rewrite history by scrubbing NFTs to appease Beijing","article":"Alibaba and Tencent recently launched support for NFTs, created NFT marketplaces, listed NFTs for sale, profiting from all of it.","url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/alibaba-tencent-tech-giants-scrub-nfts-to-appease-beijing/"},{"title":"China Crypto Ban: World's largest Bitcoin mining pool to block IP access from mainland China","article":"The latest update in the Chinese crypto ban saw the world's largest Bitcoin mining pool, Ant Pool give in to the regulatory crackdown and announced blocking IP access in mainland China, effective from 15th October.","url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/china-crypto-ban-worlds-largest-bitcoin-mining-pool-to-block-ip-access-from-mainland-china/"},{"title":"Binance.US promotes president to CEO in the wake of Brooks' departure","article":"Binance.US has promoted its president Brian Shroder to CEO after the sudden exit of Brian Brooks two months ago.","url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/binance-us-promotes-president-to-ceo-in-the-wake-of-brooks-departure/"}]}

It was created by an anonymous individual/group under the name, Satoshi Nakamoto. The source code is available publicly as an open source project, anybody can look at it and be part of the developmental process.\n\nBitcoin is changing the way we see money as we speak. The idea was to produce a means of exchange, independent of any central authority, that could be transferred electronically in a secure, verifiable and immutable way. It is a decentralized peer-to-peer internet currency making mobile payment easy, very low transaction fees, protects your identity, and it works anywhere all the time with no central authority and banks.\n\nBitcoin is designed to have only 21 million BTC ever created, thus making it a deflationary currency. Bitcoin uses the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?hashing_algorithm=SHA-256\">SHA-256</a> hashing algorithm with an average transaction confirmation time of 10 minutes. Miners today are mining Bitcoin using ASIC chip dedicated to only mining Bitcoin, and the hash rate has shot up to peta hashes.\n\nBeing the first successful online cryptography currency, Bitcoin has inspired other alternative currencies such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/litecoin\">Litecoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/peercoin\">Peercoin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/primecoin\">Primecoin</a>, and so on.\n\nThe cryptocurrency then took off with the innovation of the turing-complete smart contract by <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum\">Ethereum</a> which led to the development of other amazing projects such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/eos\">EOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/tron\">Tron</a>, and even crypto-collectibles such as <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/buzz/ethereum-still-king-dapps-cryptokitties-need-1-billion-on-eos\">CryptoKitties</a>.","homepage_link":["http://www.bitcoin.org"],"blockchain_site":["https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/","https://btc.com/","https://btc.tokenview.com/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/","github":"['https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin', 'https://github.com/bitcoin/bips']","image_url":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/1/large/bitcoin.png?1547033579","all_time_high(usd)":"67277.0","all_time_high_date":"2021-10-20T14:54:17.702Z","market_cap":"1137916033348.0","current_price":"60438.0","price_change_percentage_1y":342.60233,"price_change_percentage_30d":43.05787,"price_change_percentage_7d":-8.75538,"news":[{"title":"MicroStrategy bought close to 9000 BTC in Q3, stash now worth $7 billion","article":"MicroStrategy has revealed that it bought additional 9,000 units of Bitcoin during the third quarter of the year, bringing the worth of its holdings to around $7 billion.","url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/microstrategy-bought-close-to-9000-btc-in-q3-stash-now-worth-7-billion/"},{"title":"Bitcoin Bull Case Over Next Six Months Is Much Stronger Than Bear Case, Says Macro Strategist Lyn Alden","article":"Macro investment strategist Lyn Alden is predicting that Bitcoin (BTC) could stay bullish over the next 180 days.","url":"https://dailyhodl.com/2021/10/29/bitcoin-bull-case-over-next-six-months-is-much-stronger-than-bear-case-says-macro-strategist-lyn-alden/"}]}

Together with EvryHub (interoperability product), Evry.Finance will evolve to be next generation CeDeFi interexchange that can process transactions at high speed.

There are two key functions of attention addresses:\n\nXAC-LOCK\nXAC-Lock is a feature that encourages continued consumer engagement with AMARK. The XAC sent to Attention Addresses is initially locked and becomes available after a maturation period. The XAC attention awards paid to consumers continually matures into availability as new XAC is earned from ongoing attention marketing. This process encourages engagement with AMARK as attention wallets will rarely have a zero XAC balance, giving consumers a consistent flow of value to spend within the ecosystem.\n\nXAC-BURN\nXAC-Burn is enforced at the protocol level. All transfers to Attention Addresses require 5% of the XAC transferred to be burned. The XAC -Burn feature is designed to align interests between merchants and consumers in the AMARK ecosystem. Anytime merchants use the AMARK platform for marketing, they are supporting the value of the XAC currency as protocol rules enforces a 5% burn. As such, merchants are effectively scaling the supply of XAC to match the demand from the ecosystem. This supply-side scaling mechanism will offset new coins introduced through block rewards and pressure the price of XAC to an equilibrium reflective of demand from the ecosystem.","homepage_link":["https://amark.io/"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xde4c5a791913838027a2185709e98c5c6027ea63","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xde4c5a791913838027a2185709e98c5c6027ea63"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/amark/","github":"","image_url":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/9203/large/-LF1XcKS_400x400.png?1565131564","all_time_high(usd)":"11.53","all_time_high_date":"2021-10-04T13:43:07.221Z","market_cap":"0.0","current_price":"0.03902573","price_change_percentage_1y":-82.55698,"price_change_percentage_30d":0,"price_change_percentage_7d":-96.95719,"news":[]}

Users send and receive bitcoins, the units of currency, by broadcasting digitally signed messages to the network using bitcoin cryptocurrency wallet software. Transactions are recorded into a distributed, replicated public database known as the blockchain, with consensus achieved by a proof-of-work system called mining. Satoshi Nakamoto, the designer of bitcoin claimed that design and coding of bitcoin began in 2007. The project was released in 2009 as open source software. The network requires the minimal structure to share transactions. An ad hoc decentralized network of volunteers is sufficient. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will. Upon reconnection, a node downloads and verifies new blocks from other nodes to complete its local copy of the blockchain.\n\nA bitcoin is defined by a sequence of digitally signed transactions that began with the bitcoin's creation, as a block reward. The owner of a bitcoin transfers it by digitally signing it over to the next owner using a bitcoin transaction, much like endorsing a traditional bank check. A payee can examine each previous transaction to verify the chain of ownership. Unlike traditional check endorsements, bitcoin transactions are irreversible, which eliminates the risk of chargeback fraud.\n\nAlthough it is possible to handle bitcoins individually, it would be unwieldy to require a separate transaction for every bitcoin in a transaction. Transactions are therefore allowed to contain multiple inputs and outputs, allowing bitcoins to be split and combined. Common transactions will have either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and one or two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, to the sender. Any difference between the total input and output amounts of a transaction goes to miners as a transaction fee.\n\nIn 2013, Mark Gimein estimated electricity consumption to be about 40.9 megawatts (982 megawatt-hours a day). In 2014, Hass McCook estimated 80.7 megawatts (80,666 kW). As of 2015, The Economist estimated that even if all miners used modern facilities, the combined electricity consumption would be 166.7 megawatts (1.46 terawatt-hours per year). To lower the costs, bitcoin miners have set up in places like Iceland where geothermal energy is cheap and cooling Arctic air is free. Chinese bitcoin miners are known to use hydroelectric power in Tibet to reduce electricity costs.\n\nVarious potential attacks on the bitcoin network and its use as a payment system, real or theoretical, have been considered. The bitcoin protocol includes several features that protect it against some of those attacks, such as unauthorized spending, double spending, forging bitcoins, and tampering with the blockchain. Other attacks, such as theft of private keys, require due care by users.","homepage_link":["http://nework.pro/"],"blockchain_site":"","subreddit_url":"","github":"","image_url":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2731/large/nework.png?1547036932","all_time_high(usd)":"0.134519","all_time_high_date":"2018-05-22T01:23:34.598Z","market_cap":"0.0","current_price":"0.00626908","price_change_percentage_1y":19.7499,"price_change_percentage_30d":31.13652,"price_change_percentage_7d":0,"news":[]}

Quadrant aims to provide a blueprint for mapping disparate data sources. It will support proof of data authenticity and provenance via data stamping, the creation of “Constellations” (data smart contracts) for disparate data sources, and fair remuneration and incentive sharing. Data Consumers can trust the authenticity of the data they purchase, “Nurseries” (Data Producers) are compensated fairly every time their data is used, and “Pioneers” (Data Vendors) have the incentive to create innovative Constellations. This new transparent ecosystem ensures that companies get the authentic data they need.\n\nWhere Quadrant has major potential for impact is the ability it provides “Elons” (the brightest data minds) to find linkages between different constellations and, in turn, create mega Constellations that can be used by Data Consumers to solve real-world problems. This is where Quadrant differentiates itself from its competitors.\n\nQuadrant is designed to work with both centralised and decentralised services. The architecture consists of the core Quadrant blockchain, clients (Data Producer, Data Consumer and Anchor), and Guardian Nodes. Quadrant will operate on a Proof of Authority consensus mechanism so that it can handle more transactions, operate at a lower gas price, achieve faster transactions, and restrict malicious nodes from entering data into the network. An external Proof of Work chain will be used as an anchor for security purposes. For the time being, the Ethereum blockchain will be used for anchoring but it can be replaced by any public chain in the future if needed.\n\nQuadrant will utilise two different currencies for its network: eQuad and QUAD. QUAD, a utility token, is designed to be used solely on the network. It will be used to stamp data, support simple and complex access structures, simple and complex subscription payments, and for staking by Elons. eQuad is an ERC-20-compliant token that will be sold during the Token Generation Event (TGE). It may be converted into QUAD via a gateway when the Quadrant mainnet is launched.\n\n","homepage_link":["https://www.quadrantprotocol.com/#"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0xc28e931814725bbeb9e670676fabbcb694fe7df2","https://ethplorer.io/address/0xc28e931814725bbeb9e670676fabbcb694fe7df2"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/quadrantprotocol/","github":"","image_url":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/4462/large/equad.png?1547039783","all_time_high(usd)":"0.053012","all_time_high_date":"2021-05-16T19:50:10.955Z","market_cap":"3787486.0","current_price":"0.0069677","price_change_percentage_1y":204.27888,"price_change_percentage_30d":45.41588,"price_change_percentage_7d":8.06253,"news":[]}

For the first time ever, individual network users, corporations and enterprises can all participate in the construction of decentralized, ubiquitous and secure LPWAN. Simply by connecting “anything” to the network, adopters will be able to profit and trade MXC. \n\nThe trading network is built on the premise of the “sharing economy.” Therefore, it is uniquely and exclusively owned by users — both individuals and enterprises — who take advantage of the monetization of the network in two ways: 1. By increasing uplink and downlink coverage via a Gateway, e.g. a MatchBox LPWAN Gateway, Cisco LPWAN Gateway 2.

Its main objective is to digitize assets using the decentralized network of blockchain technology and digital identity.\n\nNeo’s main aim is to be the distributed network for “smart economy”.  As their website states: \"Digital Assets + Digital Identity + <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?category_id=29\">Smart Contract</a> = Smart Economy.\" Neo was developed by Shanghai-based blockchain R&D company “OnChain” and funded by two crowdsales: first crowdsale on October 2015 sold 17.5 million NEO tokens for $550,000 and the second crowdsale sold the remaining 22.5 million NEO tokens for $4.5 million.\n\nSo why NEO?\nAsset digitization and identity on the <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en?asset_platform_id=480\">NEO platform</a> essentially creates a novel way for asset registration, issuance, and circulation. This means that tangible assets like real estate, company shares or even fiat money can be digitized and traded on the NEO network, thus giving rise to a whole new economy.\n\nIts digital identity system allows for integration between the platform and the real world economy. It has custom digital identity standards that enable the creation of electronic identity data for individuals, organizations and even entities. These electronic systems use multi-layered authentication models that include facial and voice recognition as well as fingerprints.\n\nAll digital assets on the platform enjoy legal protection thanks to the use of digital certificates on its public blockchain. This, in turn, guarantees trust as the system offers an indelible and unalterable record of all entities’ holdings.","homepage_link":["https://neo.org/"],"blockchain_site":["https://neo.tokenview.com/","https://scan.nel.group/","https://neoscan.io/"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/NEO","github":"['https://github.com/neo-project/neo', 'https://github.com/neo-project/neo-cli', 'https://github.com/neo-project/neo-gui', 'https://github.com/CityOfZion/neon-js', 'https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-python']","image_url":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/480/large/NEO_512_512.png?1594357361","all_time_high(usd)":"198.38","all_time_high_date":"2018-01-15T00:00:00.000Z","market_cap":"2923188941.0","current_price":"41.31","price_change_percentage_1y":142.98139,"price_change_percentage_30d":10.01727,"price_change_percentage_7d":-9.19356,"news":[{"title":"Tokens.com Launches The First Publicly-Traded Company for DeFi And Metaverse Investments","article":"Tokens.com (NEO Exchange Canada: COIN) (Frankfurt Stock Exchange: 76M) (OTCQB US: SMURF) is on a mission to connect public market investors to blockchain investments by investing in DeFi tokens such as BNB and DOT, and NFT-based cryptocurrencies.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2021/10/28/tokenscom-launches-the-first-publicly-traded-company-for-defi-and-metaverse-investments/"},{"title":"Crypto-friendly remote hiring company Deel valued at $5.5 billion after Series D","article":"San Francisco-based remote hiring company Deel is now valued at $5.5 billion after a $425 million Series D funding round.","url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/headlines/news/crypto-friendly-remote-hiring-company-deel-valued-at-5-5-billion-after-series-d/"}]}

The Huobi Token (HT) rewards exchange users for their loyalty with lowered transaction fees while also carrying its own value in tradable pairs against popular currencies. The hope was to bring greater value to Huobi’s millions of users, mostly located in Asian countries. The launch of the Huobi Token follows in the footsteps of other loyalty-building tokens that other exchanges have launched. The first and most successful of these tokens has been <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/binancecoin\">Binance Coin (BNB)</a>. The creation of BNB secured Binance’s place as the world’s leading exchange. It offered discounted trading fees in exchange for customer loyalty, primarily functioning as a loyalty rewards system.\n\nHuobi officially announced its intentions to launch a new token on January 22, 2018. Over the course of 15 days, Huobi would distribute 300 million HT (60% of the total supply) to its pro users who purchased a discounted service package. Each morning, a new batch of HT would become available on a first come, first served basis. Huobi declared this token distribution scheme, “not an ICO,” due to the nature of the offering. Users are buying a specific service package, part of which includes HT that give a discount toward trading fees. The exchange launched the Huobi Token as part of an overall strategy to recover its user base after tightening regulations in China severely restricted cryptocurrency trading. In an interview with CoinDesk, Leon Li, Huobi’s founder, revealed that Chinese rule changes had decimated the trading volume on Huobi by 95% between September 15 and November 1, 2017.\n\nThe HT token distribution began on January 24 and wrapped up on February 7, 2018. Each day of the distribution, millions of tokens sold out in mere minutes after going on sale. At that point, 300 million HT had been distributed to Huobi Pro members who bought packages. That’s 60% of the total supply currently in public circulation. Another 200 million HT, 40% of the total supply, was set aside. 20% goes toward user rewards and platform operation. The other 20% is vested for four years and constitutes the team reward.\n\nHuobi isn’t the first exchange to issue its own token. Binance (BNB), <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bibox-token\">Bibox (BIX)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/kucoin-shares\">KuCoin (KCS)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/coss\">Coss (COSS)</a> have all issued their own tokens as well.","homepage_link":["https://www.hbg.com"],"blockchain_site":["https://etherscan.io/token/0x6f259637dcd74c767781e37bc6133cd6a68aa161","https://ethplorer.io/address/0x6f259637dcd74c767781e37bc6133cd6a68aa161","https://blockchair.com/ethereum/erc-20/token/0x6f259637dcd74c767781e37bc6133cd6a68aa161"],"subreddit_url":"https://www.reddit.com/r/huobi/","github":"","image_url":"https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2822/large/huobi-token-logo.png?1547036992","all_time_high(usd)":"39.66","all_time_high_date":"2021-05-12T14:42:21.586Z","market_cap":"1604019945.0","current_price":"9.73","price_change_percentage_1y":125.46431,"price_change_percentage_30d":30.94565,"price_change_percentage_7d":2.71035,"news":[{"title":"When's the right time for Binance Coin, Huobi Token and FTT to rally","article":"The broader market has already stepped into its uptrend phase.
