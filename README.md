# Information Retrieval Project
## Cryptocurrencies IR System
This project aims to build an Information Retrieval system to search cryptocurrencies and their latest news. 

The information on cryptocurrencies was gathered using HTTP requests to CoinGecko's API and cryptocurrencies' news information via scraping to CoinMarketCap. After all the inherent cleanup process and data exploration, the data was indexed using ElasticSearch. This also allowed us to make manual queries to the data. Finally, a front-end for the IR system was developed using ReactJS, allowing better visualization and filtering of the data the user wanted to search.
